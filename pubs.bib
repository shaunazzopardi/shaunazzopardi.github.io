	abstract="Distributed ledger technologies, e.g. blockchains, are an innovative solution to the problem of trust between different parties. Smart contracts, programs executing on these ledgers present new challenges given their non-traditional execution context -- blockchains. The immutability of smart contracts once they are deployed makes their pre-deployment correctness essential. This can be achieved through verification methods, which attempt to answer conclusively whether the code respects some specification. Another approach is model-driven development, where the specification is used directly to create a correct-by-const-ruction implementation. A specification may however still need to be verified to ensure it satisfies some properties. Verifying properties pre-deployment is ideal, however it may not always be possible to do completely, depending on the complexity of the smart contract. Traditionally upon failure of a verification attempt the only option is to attempt a different verification method. Recent approaches instead enable the transformation of the verification problem into a smaller problem, reducing the load of subsequent verification attempts. We have previously proposed an automata-theoretic approach to reason systematically about this kind of residual analysis for (co-)safety properties, while we have implemented an intraprocedural data-flow approach for Java programs. In this paper we extend our approach for Solidity smart contracts, present a corresponding tool, evaluate the approach with several new case studies, and compare it with existing approaches.",

abstract="Smart contracts present new challenges for runtime verification techniques, due to features such as immutability of the code and the notion of gas that must be paid for the execution of code. In this paper we present the runtime verification tool ContractLarva and outline its use in instrumenting monitors in smart contracts written in Solidity, for the Ethereum blockchain-based distributed computing platform. We discuss the challenges faced in doing so, and how some of these can be addressed, using the ERC-20 token standard to illustrate the techniques. We conclude by proposing a list of open challenges in smart contract and blockchain monitoring.",
